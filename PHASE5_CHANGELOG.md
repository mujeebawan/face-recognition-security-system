    use_fp16=True  # Recommended for Jetson
)

# Load model (once)
augmentor.load_model()

# Generate variations
generated_images = augmentor.generate_face_angles(
    reference_image=face_image,  # numpy array (BGR)
    num_variations=5,
    num_inference_steps=20,  # 20-30 for speed, 50 for quality
    guidance_scale=7.5
)

# Returns: List of numpy arrays (BGR format)

## üöß Phase 5.3: API Integration (IN PROGRESS)

**Status**: Pending

### Planned Work:
1. Add `/api/enroll` endpoint parameter: `use_augmentation: bool`
2. Integrate `StableDiffusionAugmentor` with enrollment flow

4. Extract embeddings from all generated + original images
5. Store embeddings with source metadata

### Expected Flow:
```

## üé® Fun Facts & Insights

### Why Stable Diffusion 1.5?
- Perfect balance of quality vs speed
- Well-optimized for PyTorch 2.x
- Excellent community support
- ~4GB model size (manageable on Jetson)
- SD 2.x is slower and requires more memory

### Why DPM-Solver++?
- 20 steps achieves same quality as DDIM 50 steps
- 2.5x faster generation
- Mathematically proven convergence
- No quality loss for face generation

### Prompt Engineering:
- Positive: "high quality, sharp focus, detailed face, 4k"
- Negative: "blurry, low quality, distorted face, deformed"
- These prompts dramatically improve consistency
- Guidance scale 7-8 is sweet spot for faces

### Memory Optimization:
- Attention slicing: Breaks attention computation into steps
- Reduces peak memory by 30-40%
- Only 5-10% slower
- Essential for 512x512 on 8GB GPU RAM target

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log:

**Q**: Why not use ControlNet for pose control?
**A**: ControlNet adds complexity and 1.5GB+ model size. For enrollment, prompt-based generation is sufficient. Can add ControlNet in future if needed.

**Q**: Why 512x512 resolution?
**A**: Perfect for face recognition (ArcFace uses 112x112 anyway). 512x512 is fast, uses less memory, and quality is excellent for faces.

**Q**: Why not generate all angles in parallel?
**A**: Sequential is more memory-stable on Jetson. Each generation reuses GPU memory efficiently. Parallel would risk OOM.

**Q**: Can users run this without GPU?
**A**: Technically yes (CPU), but 10-20x slower (~20-30s per image). Not recommended. GPU is essential for production use.
