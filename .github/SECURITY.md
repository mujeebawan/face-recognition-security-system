- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 60 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure
- We request 90 days before public disclosure
- We will credit you in security advisory (if desired)
- Bug bounty program: Not available at this time

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

1. **Data Protection**
   - Local processing (no cloud dependencies)
   - Biometric data encryption at rest
   - Secure database access
   - Environment variable management

2. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS support (via reverse proxy)
   - Camera credentials encrypted
   - API rate limiting (planned)
   - CORS configuration

3. **Access Control**
   - Authentication required for admin panel (planned)
   - Role-based access control (planned)
   - Session management (planned)
   - API key authentication (planned)

4. **Audit & Logging**
   - Complete audit trail of recognition events
   - Failed login attempts logged (planned)
   - Database changes logged
   - Alert system for suspicious activity

5. **Input Validation**
   - File upload size limits
   - Image format validation
   - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
   - XSS protection in web interfaces

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Camera Credentials**
   - Stored in `.env` file (not in repository)
   - Transmitted over RTSP (consider VPN for production)
   - Change default camera passwords

2. **Database**
   - SQLite for development (file-based, limited access control)
   - PostgreSQL recommended for production
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data

3. **Web Interface**
   - Currently no authentication (development only)
   - Deploy behind firewall or VPN
   - Use HTTPS in production

4. **Biometric Data**
   - Subject to privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, BIPA)
   - Obtain proper consents
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Secure deletion procedures

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### 1. Network Security

```bash
# Use firewall
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8000

# Use VPN for remote access
# Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
```

### 2. System Hardening

```bash
# Keep system updated
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Disable unnecessary services
sudo systemctl disable <service>

# Use strong passwords
# Enable automatic security updates
```

### 3. Application Security

```bash
# Secure .env file
chmod 600 .env

# Secure database
chmod 600 data/face_recognition.db

# Run as non-root user
# Use virtual environment
```

### 4. Camera Security

- Change default camera password
- Use strong, unique password
- Update camera firmware
- Disable unused camera features
- Use separate VLAN for cameras

### 5. Backup & Recovery

```bash
# Regular backups
./scripts/deployment/backup_data.sh

# Test restore procedure
# Store backups securely
# Encrypt backup files
```

### 6. Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/app.log

# Monitor failed authentications (when implemented)
# Monitor unusual recognition patterns
# Set up alerts for errors
```

### 7. Privacy Compliance

- **GDPR Compliance**:
  - Data minimization
  - Purpose limitation
  - Storage limitation
  - Right to erasure
  - Data portability

- **CCPA Compliance**:
  - Disclosure of data collection
  - Right to opt-out
  - Right to deletion

- **BIPA Compliance** (Illinois):
  - Informed consent
  - Data retention policy
  - Secure destruction

## Security Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Implement authentication
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up VPN access
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Create incident response plan
- [ ] Document security procedures
- [ ] Train operators on security
- [ ] Obtain legal review for compliance
- [ ] Get necessary permits/authorizations
- [ ] Create data retention policy
- [ ] Set up backup procedures
- [ ] Test disaster recovery

## Security Training

Team members should be familiar with:

1. **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
2. **Privacy Laws**: GDPR, CCPA, BIPA requirements
